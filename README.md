## Introduction
PascSBI is a RISC-V SBI implementation inspired by and based on [RustSBI](https://github.com/rustsbi/rustsbi).
This project aims for following goals:
1. Be a simple SBI implementation, both in size and coding technics.
2. An SBI implementation with clear code structure and easy to read.
3. An implementation that perfectly fits in our [xv6-k210](https://github.com/HUST-OS/xv6-k210) project.
4. Use Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) to abstract low-level hardware details.

## Installation and Usage
TODO

## Todo list
- build up basic frame for the project
- design the HAL API for hardware-free codes to call
- supporting QEMU and run xv6-k210 on it!
- supporting k210 and run xv6-k210 on it!
